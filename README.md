# Virtual Teacher POC Frontend

## 1. Introduction

- **Purpose**: This document provides an overview of the Virtual Teacher POC Frontend project, detailing the project's setup, features, and usage instructions.
- **Scope**: The Virtual Teacher POC Frontend app is a React-based application that integrates a 3D ReadyPlayerMe avatar with Mixamo animations. The app allows users to control the avatarâ€™s movement through keyboard inputs and interact with the avatar using text-to-speech functionality. The avatar lip-syncs using Oculus visemes.

## 2. System Overview

- **System Description**: The system consists of a React frontend app that displays a 3D avatar powered by ReadyPlayerMe and Mixamo animations. The app supports keyboard and mouse controls for avatar movement and camera rotation, and it uses the browser's Speech API to convert text input into speech, synchronized with the avatar's lip movements using Oculus visemes.

## 3. Features

- **3D Avatar**: A customizable avatar from ReadyPlayerMe, enhanced with Mixamo animations. The avatar supports movements like walking, running, jumping, crouching, and dancing.
- **Speech Interaction**: Users can type text into an input field, and the avatar will speak the text using the Speech API. The avatar lip-syncs to the speech using Oculus viseme data.
- **Movement Controls**: Users can move the avatar using the keyboard (W, A, S, D, SHIFT, Space, CTRL, X) and rotate the camera with the mouse.
- **Responsive UI**: An intuitive interface that displays instructions on how to control the avatar and interact with the app.
